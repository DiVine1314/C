11. Write a C Program to reverse the given number by the user.
12. Write a C Program to print the count of even, odd, and zeros in a given number.
    eg. Input  12340
        Output Even = 2.
               Odd  = 2.
               Zero = 1.

13. write a Program to generate the following Output.
    5
    4 5
    3 4 5
    2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5

14. Write a Program to calculate the sum of all ditits os given input number
    till it reduce to a single digit.
    eg. Input:- 489
        Output:- 3
    Explanation:- 
        4+8+9 = 21
        2+1 = 3
        therefore 3 is the output.

15. Write a C Program to Display the SUM of all elements of an 1D array.
16. Write a C Program to Find and Print Max AND Min of an 1D array.
17. Write a C Program to Count the Occurrences of a Input number in 1D array.
        eg Input :-   1 83 9 2 1 83 1
                      1
            Output:- 3
        Explanation:-
            first line is an array of N numbers.
            seconr line is an Integer entered by the user.

            output is the count of the number in the array.
            
18. Write a C program to convert specified days into years, weeks and days.
    Note: Ignore leap year.

	Test Data :
	Number of days : 1329
	Expected Output :
	Years: 3
	Weeks: 33
	Days: 3
	
19. Write a C program to calculate a bike’s average consumption from the given total distance 
    (integer value) traveled (in km) and spent fuel (in liters, float number – 2 decimal point). 
	Test Data :
	Input total distance in km: 350
	Input total fuel spent in liters: 5
	Expected Output:
	
20. Write a C program to compute the sum of the two given integer values. If the two values are 
    the same, then return triple their sum.
    
    Input : 2 1
    Output : 3  [2+1]
    
    Input : 2 2
    Output : 12  [(2+2)*3]
